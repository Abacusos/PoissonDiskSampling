# Poisson Disk Sampling Playground

The repository contains an implementation of the paper [Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf) from Robert Bridson.
It also contains a slightly modified implementation for the [Maximal Poisson disk sampling](http://extremelearning.com.au/an-improved-version-of-bridsons-algorithm-n-for-poisson-disc-sampling/). 

Catch2 was used to implement tests and benchmarks for both.
